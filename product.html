                    Event data and tracking data are the keys to unlocking football performance. But until now, tracking 
                    data has been expensive to collect, time intensive, and not available across different leagues and 
                    competitions.SkillCorner is changing that by providing teams access to exclusive player and ball tracking 
                    data without the usual restrictions. In just a click, our technology lets you access dynamic and 
                    contextualised insights that can power your recruitment process as well as match or opposition analysis.

                    and machine learning to generate tracking data from any football broadcast. The video tracking technology is 
                    capable of recognizing, positioning, and following in real time, the football players, the referee, and even 
                    the ball from any broadcasted game. They focus on four main aspects which helps put everything together to 
                    gather the most accurate data possible, the aspects are, Camera Pose Estimation, Object Detection, Multi Object

                    <em>Are there any top clubs work with SkillCorner?</em> Yes, initially SkillCorner was working with lower league football clubs 
                    which is understandable as there were new to the market and not well known. Also because they had improvements to 
                    be made and learn as they go. However around 2020-21 SkillCorner and Liverpool FC started collaborating for a period 
                    of time of 1 year long to hone the accuracy of the algorithm before agreeing to a partnership. Since then, SkillCorner 
                    has begun working with other clubs in the Premier League, Italy´s Series A, La Liga, and France´s Ligue 1.
